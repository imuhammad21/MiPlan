In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
***

     My software will provide an interface for a user that will allow him or her to log reminders to be set for a particular time to go off.  The user will input the name of the event, a description of how long it will take, and the tools they will need for it(i.e. for a paper on the Great Gatsby, the reminder will have tools = computer, computer charger, The Great Gatsby).  It will have a popup that reminds the user to complete each assignment as they work.
The reason why my software is necessary even with a multitude of calendar applications already on the market is because this app is specifically for computers and does not have the distractions that an app linked to one's phone may have.  If someone is truly trying to be productive, having a separate calendar only on their computer allows them to turn off their phone to get very invested in their own work.  I find that I struggle with having my calendar on my computer because when I am trying to do work, I am constantly reminded of obligations I have that are not work-related and distract me from my tasks at hand.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.  And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project.  I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
***

     I should be able to make a web application that takes in user input and displays it as a pop-up to the screen at a given time.

***
In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project.  I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
***

     I hope to make a web-app that is user-friendly with characteristics such as remembering users past logs as a way to make the process of recording new ones easier.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project.  I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
***

     I would love to create a web application that has a logo which I graphically design myself, which would display in the address bar.  I would be very proud of implementing a website that extends beyond the CS50 IDE
