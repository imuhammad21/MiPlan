## Questions

1. Since the server responds with the HTML that seems to directly mirror the request of the user, the request has succeeded. The
server is most likely to respond with the status code 200, which means the request has succeeded.

2. The "redirection" of the server implies that the request has been moved, and since the page /kittens no longer exists, this request
must have been moved permanently.  The status code that describes a request that had been moved permanently is 301, which is likely the
code with which the server responds.

3. The server is likely to respond with the status code 403, which means that the server understood the request, but is refusing to
fulfill it.  Because the user is not logged in, the server will not grant access to the requested material, but still understands the
request, because if the user were logged in, he or she would have access to the material.

4. The server is likely to respond with the status code 404 because the server is not likely to find anything matching the request to
brew coffee, since most computers don't have this capability.
