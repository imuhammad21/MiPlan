# Comparing Students

## Questions

1.1. int (*comp)(const void *, const void *) represents a function pointer that sorts the array in ascending order.

1.2. a and b must be typecast from const void * to const int * because in this example, we are trying to compare their numeric
values.  We can compare the numeric value of ints, which is why we cast them as such.


1.3. See `students.c`.

1.4. See `students.py`.

1.5. See `students.js`.
