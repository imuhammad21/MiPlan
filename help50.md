# Helping `help50`

## Questions

1. "%" gives remainder after integer division.  Try using an int instead.

2. get_string() is the proper usage of the function get_string.  You provided no place for the recieved string to go.

3. Try initializing an array of unsigned chars instead.

4. Putting {NULL} in curly braces automatically inserts a '\0' as the last element in the array.  Try remvoing the curly braces so
that your scalar intilaizer has only one element.
